## Introduction

Background Blur has become one of the most used features on Video conferencing web apps like [Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/virtual-meeting-backgrounds), [Meet](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2020/09/blur-your-background-in-google-meet.html), [Zoom](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360061468611-Using-blurred-background-), [Webex](https://help.webex.com/en-us/article/0p4gb1/Webex-App-%7C-Use-a-virtual-or-blurred-background-in-calls-and-meetings), etc. We want to achieve the goal of giving all the Web apps similar levers as their native counterparts, leveraging the same platform APIs and to delight users without completely relying on ML frameworks like TensorFlow.js, [Mediapipe](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/10/background-features-in-google-meet.html), etc, or cloud based solutions.

## Use Cases

A vast majority of communication these days happens on our client devices. During video meetings, participants are usually aware of how they look and what their environment (usually their home) is revealing to the audience. Most folks, especially ones without a dedicated office space would be inclined to hide messy rooms with pets and kids. Video meetings like face to face meetings are important for non-verbal communication but participants would rather focus on the important subject by removing the distractions in the background and prevent any accidental snafus. [Microsoft says](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ww/microsoft-365/business-insights-ideas/resources/how-custom-backgrounds-keep-the-focus-on-you) in a 38 minute conference call, 13 minutes are wasted dealing with distractions and interruptions. Background Blur goes a long way to cutting down those disruptions. [Zoom says](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360061468611-Using-blurred-background)- "_When a custom virtual background is unavailable or not suiting your needs, but you still want to maintain some privacy with regards to your surroundings, the blur background option can be a great alternative. This option simply blurs the background of your video, obscuring exactly who or what is behind you. It's great for hiding a cluttered dorm room, taking a meeting in a coffee shop, or just keeping things professional._" . In fact, NCSC (National Cyber Security Centre UK) [suggests using background Blur or a background image](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/video-conferencing-services-security-guidance-organisations) for staff meetings to add a degree of personal privacy.

On the Web, due to a lack of a standardized JS API for Background Blur and widespread demand, developers have no options but to use ML frameworks like Tensorflow.js and other WASM libraries to satify their customers. This Background Blur API gives developers a **choice** to use the native platform's API. This would ensure conformance to the corresponding native apps.


## Goals

* Ideally, Background Blur API should work with APIs like [Face Detection](https://github.com/riju/faceDetection/blob/main/explainer.md#goals). Face detection would help to either provide a [mask (countour) or at least the bounding box co-ordinates](https://github.com/riju/faceDetection/blob/main/explainer.md#face-detection-api) which might help Background Blur to compute faster. In many cases platforms will do an in-stream correction and explicit face detection might not be needed at the browser level. In that case the detectedFaces options can be nullable.

* Background Blur API should have options similar to what consumers demand, things possible on ML frameworks but not yet exposed by present day Platform APIs like Blur Level. Users might want to use blur intensity based on who they are communicating with.

* Background Blur API should work with [Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers).

## Non-goals

One adjacent goal was to combine Background Replacement with Background Blur as part of an overall Background Concealment API. Presently there's no platform APIs to support Background Replacement (green screen, animated gif, image, video). Combining both might be too premature. Instead, we would like to keep Background Replacement as a separate feature proposal for a later date.

## Performance

Background blur, using the proposed Javascript API, was compared to several other alternatives in power usage.
The results were normalized against base case (viewfinder only, no background blur) and are shown in the following chart.

![Package Power Consumption](ptat-bg5fps-rel.png)

Javacript test programs were created to capture frames and to blur background at VGA resolution (640x480) at 5 fps. The tests were run on Intel Tigerlake running Windows 11. A test run length was 120 seconds (2 minutes) with 640x480 pixel frame resolution. 

## User research

* TEAMS : Supportive. Let’s start with a MVP and add Background Replacement feature later.

*Agreed, [Background Replacement is now stated as Future Work](https://github.com/riju/backgroundBlur/blob/main/explainer.md#non-goals). 
Some of the new features on Windows have [requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/stream/ksproperty-cameracontrol-extended-backgroundsegmentation#requirements) which might not be available to a lot of users right away, so we work on a minimal set which works on a broader set of clients and add newer features later.*


* MEET : Supportive, but Segmentation Mask is a basic building block in MediaPipe.

*We discussed that MASK would be more important in Background Replacement scenarios. Since no platform APIs support Background Replacement right now, we decided to move it to [future work](https://github.com/riju/backgroundBlur/blob/main/explainer.md#non-goals).*

## Background Blur API

This is about bringing platform background concealment capabilities to the web so constrainable media track capabilities fit naturally to the purpose. Because the concealment is (or should be) implemented by the platform media pipeline, it is enough for an (web) application to control the concealment through constrainable properties. The application does not have to (and actually cannot) do the actual concealment in this case. The concealment is already done before the application receives video frames. On Apple devices, Background Blur is controlled globally from Command Center and as such any app cannot independently switch on/off the feature. 

* backgroundBlur.idl
```js
partial dictionary MediaTrackSupportedConstraints {
  boolean backgroundBlur = true;
};

partial dictionary MediaTrackCapabilities {
  MediaSettingsRange backgroundBlur;
};

partial dictionary MediaTrackConstraintSet {
  MediaSettingsRange backgroundBlur;
};

partial dictionary MediaTrackSettings {
  double backgroundBlur;
};

```

## Exposing change of MediaStreamTrack configuration

The configuration (capabilities, constraints or settings) of a MediaStreamTrack may be changed dynamically outside the control of web applications.
One example is when a user decides to switch on background blur through the operating system.
Web applications might want to know that the configuration of a particular MediaStreamTrack has changed.
For that purpose, a new event is defined below.

```js
partial interface MediaStreamTrack {
  attribute EventHandler onconfigurationchange;
};
```

## Example

 * main.js:
   ```js
   // main.js:
   // Open camera.
   const stream = navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({video: true});
   const [videoTrack] = stream.getVideoTracks();

   // Use a video worker and show to user.
   const videoElement = document.querySelector('video');
   const videoWorker = new Worker('video-worker.js');
   videoWorker.postMessage({videoTrack: videoTrack}, [videoTrack]);
   const {data} = await new Promise(r => videoWorker.onmessage);
   videoElement.srcObject = new MediaStream([data.videoTrack]);
   ```
 * video-worker.js:
   ```js
   self.onmessage = async ({data: {videoTrack}}) => {
     const processor = new MediaStreamTrackProcessor({videoTrack});
     let readable = processor.readable;

     const capabilities = videoTrack.getCapabilities();
     if (capabilities.backgroundBlur && capabilities.backgroundBlur.max > 0) {
       // The platform supports background blurring.
       // Let's use platform background blurring.
       // No transformers are needed.
       await track.applyConstraints({
         advanced: [{backgroundBlur: capabilities.backgroundBlur.max}]
       });
     } else {
       // The platform does not support background blurring.
       // Let's use custom face detection to aid custom background blurring.
       importScripts('custom-face-detection.js', 'custom-background-blur.js');
       const transformer = new TransformStream({
         async transform(frame, controller) {
           // Use a custom face detection.
           const detectedFaces = await detectFaces(frame);
           // Use a custom background blurring.
           const newFrame = await blurBackground(frame, detectedFaces);
           frame.close();
           controller.enqueue(newFrame);
         }
       });
       // Pipe through a custom transformer.
       readable = readable.pipeThrough(transformer);
     };
     if (readable === processor.readable) {
       // No transformers were needed.
       // Pass the original track back to the main.
       parent.postMessage({videoTrack: videoTrack}, [videoTrack]);
     } else {
       // Transformers were needed.
       // Use a generator to generate a new video track and pass it to the main.
       const generator = new VideoTrackGenerator();
       parent.postMessage({videoTrack: generator.track}, [generator.track]);
       await readable.pipeTo(generator.writable);
     }
   };
   ```

## Security considerations

Background Blur feature would not expose any more security concerns compared to a video call without it. Since there's demand for Background Blur many products use a cloud based solution to satisfy conformance across a myriad of client devices. Modern clients are quite efficient these days to handle such popular tasks like Background Blur, either by leveraging AI accelerators or using specific vector instructions like AVX.

## Privacy considerations

Background Blur is supposed to enhance Privacy of the user compared to a video call without it. Many times users are in a video call where they do not know the audience well enough. It's advisable to not accidentally share any more personal information than required which might be otherwise be exposed without any form of Background Concealment. When in doubt, it's better to blur it out and users would change the blur intensity depending on who is on the other side of the call.
